Greetings, welcome to my bootstrap powered portfolio!

## Welcome

Hello all, welcome to my professional code portfolio! Please see below for a brief summary of the projects included.

## Budgeting app

This budget app allows the user to keep track of their payments and income on both the home page as well as the calendar page. The app also allows the user to set their budgets which updated when the user puts in an expense

## Password generator

This app automatically creates a password based on the options the user chooses or creates an automated password that is set to the default options

## Daily planner

Using this app allows the user to track daily tasks they need to get done throughout the day. The app is divided by hour which automatically changes according to the local time of user. The user can also save their tasks so that they can even view their tasks after closing the app.
